       <div class="para1">
        The foundations of component-level design for traditional software components7
        were formed in the early 1960s and were solidified with the work of Edsger Dijkstra
        and his colleagues ([Boh66], [Dij65], [Dij76b]). In the late 1960s, Dijkstra and others
        proposed the use of a set of constrained logical constructs from which any program
        could be formed. The constructs emphasized “maintenance of functional domain.”
        That is, each construct had a predictable logical structure and was entered at the
        top and exited at the bottom, enabling a reader to follow procedural flow more
        easily.

       <div class="para2">
        The constructs are sequence, condition, and repetition. Sequence implements
        processing steps that are essential in the specification of any algorithm. Condition
        provides the facility for selected processing based on some logical occurrence, and
        repetition allows for looping. These three constructs are fundamental to structured
        programming—an important component-level design technique.
        The structured constructs were proposed to limit the procedural design of
        software to a small number of predictable logical structures.
